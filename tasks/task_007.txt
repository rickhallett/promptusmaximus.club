# Task ID: 7
# Title: Connect Form Submission to API Route
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Link the form submission to the API route and handle the redirect flow.
# Details:
Update the form to properly submit to the /api/subscribe endpoint. Handle form submission either through traditional form submission or using JavaScript to make a fetch request. Ensure the redirect to the Thanks page works correctly after successful submission. Add error handling to display validation errors to the user.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete flow from form submission to redirect. Verify both successful submissions and error cases work as expected.
