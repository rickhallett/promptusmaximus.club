# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create API Route for Email Subscription
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the serverless API route to handle form submissions and integrate with Resend.
# Details:
Create an API route at app/api/subscribe/route.ts using Next.js App Router conventions. Implement the POST handler to validate form data (check email format and honeypot field). Install the Resend SDK with `npm install resend`. Use the SDK to add the email to a contact list. Return appropriate status codes (400 for invalid submissions, 302 redirect to /thanks for successful ones).

# Test Strategy:
Test the API route with various inputs: valid emails, invalid emails, and submissions with filled honeypot fields. Verify correct status codes are returned.
