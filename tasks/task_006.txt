# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the 'Thanks' page with a Stoic quote and back button.
# Details:
Create a new page at app/thanks/page.tsx. Design the page with a thank you message, a Stoic quote (e.g., "The impediment to action advances action." â€” Marcus Aurelius), and a button to return to the home page. Maintain the same styling and brand voice as the landing page.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the page renders correctly and the back button works. Ensure the styling is consistent with the landing page.
