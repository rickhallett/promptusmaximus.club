# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Landing Page Layout and Hero Section
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the main landing page with hero section following the Stoic-gladiator Ã— AI wizard brand voice.
# Details:
Create page.tsx in the app directory with a responsive hero section. Use Tailwind for styling with the dark stone background. Include the main slogan and brand messaging. Ensure the layout is mobile-friendly and maintains the brand voice. Add a container for the signup form (to be implemented in the next task).

# Test Strategy:
Manually verify the page renders correctly on different screen sizes. Check that the brand voice is consistent and the design matches the dark gladiator palette.
