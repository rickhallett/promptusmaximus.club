# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the email capture form on the landing page with basic client-side validation.
# Details:
Add a form to the landing page with an email input field and submit button. Implement basic client-side validation using HTML5 validation attributes. Style the form using Tailwind classes to match the overall design. Set the form action to POST to the /api/subscribe endpoint (to be created later).

# Test Strategy:
Test form submission with valid and invalid email formats to verify client-side validation works correctly.
